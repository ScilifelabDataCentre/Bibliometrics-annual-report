# Bibliometrics-annual-report
This repository holds the python scripts to create the bibliometrics analysis completed for the annual report 2020 

There are 4 main types of code to be considered here:

1) Scripts within JIF involve looking at publication numbers for a given group over time. These scripts deal with aligning JIF scores to publications and producing barcharts to show the number of publications produced in each year. 
2) Scripts within Venn look at overlaps in the number of publications between groups. 
3) Scripts within MNCStest consider the calculation of the mean normalised citation scores. The scripts enable the calculation of the MNCS as well as produce the associated graphs.  
4) Scripts within pptoptentest consder the calculation of the percentage of publications in the top 10% most cited (PP(top10)). The scripts enable the calculation of the pp(top10) as well as produce the associated graphs.
